<Callout title="Note">
**MAWs (Monthly Active Wallets)** refers to the total number of unique wallets where a user performs at least one on-chain **session** in a Web3 application using the Okto SDK within a calendar month (30 days). 

  **A session** is defined as either of the following:
  - **Transaction**: Includes on-chain transactions, token claims, or any on-chain activity.
  - **Active Interaction**: Any interaction where the user logs in, refreshes their portfolio, or invokes the Okto platform API.

Each wallet's sessions are capped at a maximum of 5 per month (30 days). Therefore, if a unique wallet completes 12 sessions, it will count as 3 MAWs (12/5=3, rounded up to the nearest whole number).
