title: Rate Limits
description: To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Okto SDK API enforces rate limits on requests.

## Production Rate Limits

In the production environment, a rate limit is applied to all **<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>POST</span> orders**.

- **Request Limit**: 1,500 API calls per 5-minute window
- **Applies to**: All POST operations
- **Reset Period**: Every 5 minutes


### Error Response

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive the following error response:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "errorCode": "ER-TECH-0100",
        "message": "Rate Limit Exceeded",
        "trace_id": "678a3f1e00000000ced7e3483989507c"
    }
}
```

As per industry standards, a **`retry-after` response header** will be included when a rate-exceeded error is encountered. The value of this header indicates the **time (in seconds)** after which the rate limit restriction will expire. You can retry your request after this period. 


## Affected Endpoints

### Client Write APIs
- `POST /api/v1/transfer/tokens/execute`
- `POST /api/v1/nft/transfer`
- `POST /api/v1/readContractData`
- `POST /api/v1/rawtransaction/execute`

### Server Write APIs
- `POST /s2s/api/v1/wallet`
- `POST /s2s/api/v1/bulk-wallets`
- `POST /s2s/api/v2/nft/mint`
- `POST /s2s/api/v2/nft/transfer`
- `POST /s2s/api/v2/transfer/tokens/execute/{userId}`
- `POST /s2s/api/v1/readContractData`
- `POST /s2s/api/v1/rawtransaction/execute/{TW_USER_ID}`


### **How Rate Limiting Works**
The **five-minute interval** starts from the first API request each day.

For example:
- If the first request is sent at **12:02 am**, the rate limit applies from **12:02 am to 12:07 am**
- A maximum of 1,500 requests can be made within this period.
- The interval resets every five minutes.
