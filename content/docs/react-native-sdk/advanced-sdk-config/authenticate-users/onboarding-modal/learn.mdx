# What is the Onboarding Modal?

Okto’s **Onboarding Widget** provides a **streamlined** way to authenticate users by displaying an embeddable flow without requiring them to leave your mobile app. Under the hood, the **Onboarding Widget** can handle multiple authentication flows (Email OTP, Phone OTP, Google OAuth, etc.) and can be customized with brand data, visuals, and theming.

## Why Use the Onboarding Modal?

1. **No Authentication Flow Management**  
   Vendors need not work or worry about the authentication flow or the code for it. Okto handles everything on the server side, simplifying the implementation and saving development time.

2. **Multi-Auth Support**  
   The modal can be set up to handle Google Auth, Email OTP, Phone OTP, or your primary authentication of choice.

3. **Brand & Theme Customizations**  
   Pass your branding (title, subtitle, icon) and theming (colors, backgrounds, etc.) to tailor the onboarding experience to your style guidelines.

## Typical Flow

Below is a simplified sequence for how the Onboarding Modal works:

1. **Trigger the Modal**  
  Your code calls `showOnboardingWidget()` (or manually opens `<OnboardingScreen ref={...} ... />`) from the Okto React Native SDK. This launches an **Onboarding** flow inside your app.

2. **Iframe Initialization**  
  The iframe loads the Okto environment for your selected `BuildType` (Sandbox, Staging, or Production).  
  It also receives your brand data, theming, and selected primary authentication method.

3. **User Authentication**  
  The user completes the steps (e.g., Google login, Email OTP, or Phone OTP). If the flow requires an external token (like a Google ID token), Okto can request it from your app via `gAuthCb()`.

4. **Auth Success**  
  Once the user is authenticated, Okto returns the relevant tokens (`authToken`, `refreshToken`, etc.) and closes the onboarding screen automatically. At that point, your React Native app can continue with a fully authenticated user.

## Key Points to Remember

- **`showOnboardingWidget()`** is your main entry point to launch the **Onboarding Flow**.
- You can customize brand data, theming, and the primary auth method (Email, Phone, or Google).
- For Google OAuth, provide a callback (`gAuthCb`) that returns an ID token from your own sign-in flow (e.g., `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`).
- On success, your app will have the user’s `authToken` (and refresh token) stored in Okto’s internal state.

If you’re building for both iOS and Android, ensure each platform has the proper Client ID set up in the [Google Cloud Console](/docs/react-native-sdk/advanced-sdk-config/authenticate-users/google-oauth/google-console-setup-android) & [iOS setup](/docs/react-native-sdk/advanced-sdk-config/authenticate-users/google-oauth/google-console-setup-ios).
