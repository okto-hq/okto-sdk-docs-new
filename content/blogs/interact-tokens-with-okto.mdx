<strong>TL;DR:</strong>
<em>Learn how to enable chains and tokens, interact with APIs, and manage tokens seamlessly using the Okto SDK. A single API call empowers developers to build powerful token-based dApps without blockchain complexities.</em>

## Introduction: The Power of Tokens with Okto

Tokens are at the heart of blockchain applications. Whether you’re building DeFi platforms, gaming ecosystems, or NFT marketplaces, tokens drive user interactions and utility. However, <strong>working with tokens across multiple chains</strong> has historically been a nightmare.

Each blockchain has its own standards for accounts, token handling, and transaction flows, forcing developers to:

- Learn chain-specific models (e.g., account-based vs. UTXO).
- Construct intricate transaction objects.
- Manage gas fees, nonce handling, and retries.

This fragmented experience has made cross-chain development a daunting task.

<strong>Enter Okto.</strong> Okto abstracts away these challenges, offering a seamless and unified way to interact with tokens across diverse ecosystems. With Okto, transferring tokens (whether native, ERC20, or other fungible assets) across any of the diverse chains becomes as simple as one API call. No chain-specific nuances, no transaction complexity. Just a clean, developer-friendly experience.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to enable blockchain networks (chains) and whitelist tokens on the Okto dashboard. We’ll also dive into various API functions provided by the Okto SDK that allow you to interact with tokens.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped to integrate token interactions into your applications, unlocking the full potential of cross-chain development without the blockchain headaches.

## Enabling Chains and Whitelisting Tokens

Before you can start interacting with tokens, it’s essential to configure which <strong>blockchain networks (chains)</strong> and <strong>tokens</strong> your application will support. This configuration is done through the Okto dashboard’s <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> feature.

### Enabling Chains

Chains represent the blockchain networks your users can access. By enabling specific chains, you determine which blockchain ecosystems your users can interact with through their Okto wallet.

<strong>To enable a chain:</strong>

1. Log in to the <strong>[Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login)</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Chains & Tokens</strong> section of the <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> page on your Okto dashboard.

2. Click on the <strong>Enable Chain</strong> button.

3. In the pop-up window, you’ll see a list of available chains, including <strong>mainnet</strong> and <strong>testnet</strong> options.

4. Select the <strong>chain(s)</strong> you want to enable for your users.

5. Click <strong>Enable Chain(s)</strong> to confirm your selection.

### Enabling Tokens

Tokens represent the cryptocurrencies and digital assets your users can manage within their Okto wallet. You can choose from a list of whitelisted tokens for each enabled chain to ensure the assets relevant to your app are available to users.

1. Log in to the [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login) and navigate to the <strong>Chains & Tokens</strong> section of the <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> page on your Okto dashboard.

2. Click on the <strong>Enable Token(s)</strong> button.

3. In the pop-up window, you’ll see a list of available tokens for the enabled chains.

## Interacting with Tokens via Okto SDK APIs

Now that you’ve enabled the desired chains and tokens, you can start interacting with them using the <strong>Okto SDK APIs</strong>. These APIs abstract the complexities of cross-chain operations, allowing you to perform critical actions like token transfers, portfolio management, and transaction tracking — all with just a few API calls.

## 1. Transferring Tokens: One API Call to Rule Them All

Transferring tokens across blockchains can be daunting due to differing account structures, gas fee mechanisms, and transaction object requirements. With <strong>Okto SDK</strong>, it’s as simple as one API call . You don’t need to manage chain-specific transaction logic.

<strong>Key Benefits:</strong>

- <strong>Unified Experience:</strong> Transfer native and non-native tokens across multiple chains with the same API structure.
- <strong>Simplified Process:</strong> No manual gas estimation, nonce management, or transaction construction.
- <strong>Cross-Chain Compatibility:</strong> Works seamlessly for blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and more.

<strong>Endpoint:</strong> `POST /api/v1/transfer/tokens/execute`

<strong>Sample Request:</strong>

```bash
POST https://sandbox-api.okto.tech/api/v1/transfer/tokens/execute
